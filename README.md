# Vita-No-Battery
A mod for the PS Vita which allows you to run your PS Vita from only a USB supply.
This project is still a work in progress, but I have posted a prototype version on Reddit which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/vitahacks/comments/d63pa4/run_your_vita_off_of_wall_power_only_no_battery/

# Update
A few months after I made this mod to one of my Vitas, it stopped turning on, even when the mod was removed. This might have been due to the battery controller trying to adjust for the new "battery" over time and blocking the startup of the console. In addition, although it was a long time ago, I remember seeing a post on the Henkaku Discord where someone (theFlow maybe?) posted that the battery controller has no voltage protection, so each time the battery is plugged in, if the positive wire is connected before the ground, there's a chance the floating voltage will damage the battery controller and brick the console (and the battery controller is a tiny QFN chip, so good luck replacing it). Overall I'd say that this mod is interesting academically, but probably not stable in the long run.
