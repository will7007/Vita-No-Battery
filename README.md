# Vita-No-Battery
A mod for the PS Vita which allows you to run your PS Vita from only a USB supply.
This project is still a work in progress, but I have posted a prototype version on Reddit which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/vitahacks/comments/d63pa4/run_your_vita_off_of_wall_power_only_no_battery/
